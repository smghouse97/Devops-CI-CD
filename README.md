# Automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Docker, and AWS
#
#### The goal of this project is to build a CI/CD pipeline for a Java project that automates the build, test, and deployment process using Jenkins, Docker, and AWS. The pipeline will be triggered every time code is pushed to the project's GitHub repository, and it will deploy the updated version of the application to an AWS EC2 instance.
